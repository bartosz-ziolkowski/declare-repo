  - Browse and search stored models
  - Filter models based on various metrics and characteristics
  - Download models for reuse

- **Metric Analysis**
  - Automatic calculation of key metrics:
    - Size
    - Density  
    - Constraint Variability
    - Number of Activities
    - Number of Constraints
    - Separability
    - Semantic Redundancy
    - Consistency
    - Purpose
    - Application Domain

- **API Integration**
  - RESTful API for programmatic access
  - Comprehensive API documentation via Swagger UI
  - Secure authentication and authorization
